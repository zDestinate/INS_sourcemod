# [INS] Server sourcemod
These are the public source from [INS] server.<br>
You may modify it and use it on your server as long as you give credit.<br>
Some of the files here are reharsh version and some of the files are originally from other devs. The reason I put these files here is cuz we using it on our server.<br><br>

NOTE: Most of the plugins here is link with the server theater files. If you are using the plugins without the server theater files, you will find some function not working. However, if you know how to edit it then you can use it.<br><br>
